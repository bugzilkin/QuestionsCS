# QuestionsCS

It's a repository with answers for programming skills testing.

Questions are the following:

1.    Write a function to find maximum product (multiplication) of two numbers in an array.
For example: array = [5, 2, 8, 14], max product result = 14 * 8 = 112

2.    Write a function that reverses the order of the words in a string.
For example, your function should transform the string "Do or do not, there is no try." to "try.no is there not, do or Do".
Assume that all words are space delimited and treat punctuation the same as letters.

3.    Implement a non-recursive function to perform a binary search on a sorted array of integers to find the index of a given integer.
Comment on the efficiency of this search, and compare it with other search methods.

4.    Implement a recursive version of the question #3 and explain the pros and cons.

5.    What are virtual methods? Why are they useful? Please provide an example.
